## 🧠 Development Workflow

This project uses a simple and clean Git workflow

- All work happens in feature branches (e.g., `feature/hero-section`)
- Each branch corresponds to a GitHub issue
- Once complete, a pull request is opened into the `main` branch
- The PR must include a clear description and link to the issue

### 🥕 Example Branching Flow

1. Open a GitHub issue (e.g. `[feature] Add hero section`)
2. Create a feature branch:
   git checkout -b feature/hero-section
3. Commit changes related to that issue only
4. Push the branch and open a PR targeting `main`
5. Merge after review (even if it's solo)

This workflow allows for clean tracking of progress, feature isolation, and easier maintenance.
